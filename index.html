  <h1>Network Problems and Solutions According to OSI Layers</h1>

<div class="layer-box">
  <h2>PROBLEM 1: L1 – Physical Layer Issue</h2>
  <p><strong>🛠️Problem:</strong><br> In this scenario, the PC and Server devices are connected to a Switch.<br>
• The PC ↔ Switch connection is made with a Copper Straight-through Cable and it is working properly.<br>
• The Server ↔ Switch connection is made with a Console Cable (blue cable).<br>
• The console cable is only used for device management; it does not transmit data.<br>

<p><strong>💬 Symptom:</strong><br>
• It appears that the physical connection exists.<br>
• The LED light turns red or does not light up at all.<br>
• ping command fails: Request timed out.<br>

<p><strong>🧪 Diagnosis:</strong><br>
• Wrong cable type → physical signal cannot be transmitted.<br>
• The server cannot receive or respond to data.<br>
• The problem is entirely caused by the Physical Layer (Layer 1).<br>
• The packet is lost at the cable level before even reaching the Switch.<br>

<p><strong>📁 Faulty Scenario File:</strong><br>
<a href="cisco/S1-hatalı.pkt" target="_blank">L1 Faulty Scenario - Packet Tracer File</a> (.pkt)<br>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
• Remove the Console Cable connection.<br>
• Choose the correct cable type (Copper Straight-through Cable – green colored).<br>
• Connect Server0 FastEthernet0 → Switch0 Fa0/2.<br>
• Assign an IP to the Server: IP: 192.168.1.2 / Subnet: 255.255.255.0<br>
• Run the command ping 192.168.1.2 again → Reply from 192.168.1.2:.......<br><br>
📌 In this issue, although it looks like a physical connection is established, the wrong type of cable prevents data transmission. Console cables do not support data transfer. Therefore, communication fails, and an error occurs. The solution is to ensure the physical connection using the correct cable. This is a typical Physical Layer (L1) issue.

<div class="layer-box">
  <h2>PROBLEM 2: L2 – MAC Flooding and Port Security</h2>
  <p><strong>🛠️Problem:</strong><br>
• Switch ports automatically learn the MAC addresses of connected devices.<br>
• If Port Security is not enabled, a malicious user can send thousands of fake MAC addresses from a single port.<br>
• This causes the Switch's MAC address table to overflow.<br>
</p>
When the table is full:<br>
o The switch cannot find the destination MAC address.<br>
o It starts to broadcast (flood) to all ports.<br>
o The attacker can see all the traffic in the network.<br></p>

<p><strong> 💥 Incorrect Configuration:</strong><br>
• No port security is enabled on the switch.<br>
• Multiple devices are connected to the same port.<br>
• Multiple MAC addresses are being added to the MAC address table.<br>
• The switch accepts all MAC addresses (unsafe behavior).<br>

<p><strong> 🧪 Cisco Test Evidence:</strong><br>
Switch# show mac address-table<br>
Vlan   MAC Address     Type      Port<br>
1      00D0.AAAA.1111  DYNAMIC   Fa0/1<br>
1      00D0.BBBB.2222  DYNAMIC   Fa0/1<br>
Two different MACs came from the same port = security vulnerability<br>

<p><strong>⚠️ Why is this dangerous?</strong><br>
• In real-world environments, this behavior violates data security.<br>
• Attackers can eavesdrop on traffic belonging to others.<br>
• It represents a serious vulnerability at Layer 2.<br>

<p><strong>📁 Faulty Scenario File:</strong><br>
<a href="cisco/S2-hatalı.pkt" target="_blank">L2 Faulty Scenario - Packet Tracer File</a> (.pkt)<br>

<p><strong>✅ Solution:</strong><br>
• Port Security should be enabled on switch ports.<br>
• Each port should allow only a single MAC address.<br>
• The MAC address of the first connected device is automatically learned using the sticky method.<br><br>
• If another device connects to the same port:<br>
o The switch detects it.<br>
o The port automatically shuts down.<br>

<a href="cisco/S2-dogru.pkt" target="_blank">L2 Correct Scenario - Packet Tracer File</a> (.pkt)<br>

<p><strong>🛡️ Settings:</strong><br>
• Port: Fa0/1<br>
• Maximum MAC: 1<br>
• Violation Action: shutdown<br>
• MAC Recording: sticky<br>

<p><strong>📄 Cisco CLI Evidence:</strong><br>
Switch# show port-security interface fa0/1<br>
Port Security              : Enabled<br>
Port Status                : Secure-shutdown<br>
Violation Count            : 1<br>

<p><strong>Cisco CLI Commands:</strong></p>
<pre>Switch> enable
Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# interface fastEthernet 0/1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security
Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security maximum 1
Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security violation shutdown
Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security mac-address sticky
Switch(config-if)# end
Switch# write memory
</pre>

<p><strong>📈 Result:</strong><br>
• The first incoming MAC address is recorded automatically.<br>
• If another MAC address is received → the port shuts down.<br>
• This configuration prevents MAC Flooding attacks and allows only authorized devices to access the network.<br>
• Strong security control is ensured at the Data Link Layer (L2).<br>

 <div class="layer-box">
  <h2>PROBLEM 3: L3 – IP Issue in Different Subnet</h2>
  <p><strong>🛠️Problem:</strong><br> 
• The network layer (L3) enables communication by assigning IP addresses to devices.<br>
• Devices within the same local network must be assigned IP addresses from the same subnet.<br>
• If IPs are assigned from different subnets, devices cannot ping each other.<br>
• In this project, although two PCs are connected to the same Switch, they were unable to communicate because they were configured with IP addresses from different subnets.<br>

  <h2>PROBLEM: L4 – HTTP Port 80 Service Disabled</h2>
  <p><strong>🛠️Problem:</strong><br>
The Transport Layer ensures that data transmitted over the network is correctly directed to the appropriate applications at the destination. This redirection is performed via port numbers. Example ports:<br>
• HTTP → Port 80<br>
• HTTPS → Port 443<br>
• FTP → Port 21<br>
In this scenario, the client (PC0) wants to access the web server (Server) on the same network via HTTP. However, the HTTP service on the server is turned off.<br>

  <h2>PROBLEM 6: L6 – Presentation Layer Issue (Unformatted index.html)</h2>
  <p><strong>🛠️ Problem:</strong><br>
    The Presentation Layer is responsible for presenting the transmitted data in a format that is understandable and processable by the Application Layer. However, an error at this layer may cause the data received by the client (PC) to appear meaningless or unformatted. In this case, although the client receives data from the server, it cannot interpret it.
  </p>

  <p><strong>🚫 Faulty Case:</strong><br>
    Although the HTTP service is running on the server, the default HTML page is either not formatted or consists of an empty text. When the user accesses http://192.168.10.20, they are met with either a blank page or unformatted content. This indicates a failure in the functionality of the Presentation Layer.
  </p>

  <p><strong>📁 Faulty Scenario File:</strong><br>
  <a href="cisco/S6-hatalı.pkt" target="_blank">L6 Faulty Scenario - Packet Tracer File</a> (.pkt)<br>

  <p><strong>✅ Solution:</strong><br>
  The HTTP service on the server has been activated, and the “index.html” file has been updated with a proper HTML structure. With HTML formatting, the data can be easily interpreted by the client and displayed correctly. This ensures that the Presentation Layer transmits data in the correct format.<br><br>

  🔧 Cisco Packet Tracer Setup:<br>
  PC and Server are configured on the same network (192.168.10.x)<br>
  The HTTP service is active on the server<br>

  <h2>PROBLEM 7: L7 – Application Layer Issue: DNS Not Registered / Name Resolution Fails</h2>
  <p><strong>🛠️Problem:</strong> A client device (PC) receives a "Host name unresolved" error when trying to access a website (www.ornek.com). This error occurs when the browser is unable to translate the URL into a corresponding IP address. The root cause is that either the DNS service is not active or there is no DNS record for the requested domain.</p>

  <p><strong>🔍 Faulty Scenario:</strong><br>
• DNS service is turned off or inactive.<br>
• The domain name www.ornek.com is not listed in the DNS records.<br>
• When www.ornek.com is entered in the browser, "hostname unresolved" error is received.<br>

  <h2>PROBLEM 8: Incorrect VLAN Configuration</h2>
  <p><strong>🛠️Problem:</strong><br>
Two computers (PC0 and PC1), although connected to the same switch, are unable to ping each other. Despite correct cabling and IP configurations, a “Request timed out” error is received. This indicates a problem originating from the Data Link Layer (L2).<br>
  </p>

  <p><strong>🧯 Technical Cause:</strong><br>
The ports on the switch are not assigned to the same VLAN.<br>
Example:<br>
PC0 → Fa0/1 → VLAN 10<br>
PC1 → Fa0/2 → VLAN 1 (default)<br>
  </p>

  <p><strong>📁 Faulty Scenario File:</strong><br>
  <a href="cisco/S8-hatalı.pkt" target="_blank">L8 Faulty Scenario - Packet Tracer File</a> (.pkt)<br>

  <p>This situation creates a Layer 2 broadcast domain mismatch between the PCs. Even though they are in the same IP network, the data cannot reach each other.<br></p>

  <p><strong>✅ Solution:</strong> All ports must be assigned to the same VLAN to ensure L2 broadcast domain compatibility.
The following commands were applied via Cisco CLI:</p>

<pre>enable
configure terminal

vlan 10
name ORTAK_VLAN
exit

interface fastethernet0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
exit

interface fastethernet0/2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
exit

end
write memory
</pre>

<p><strong>🧪 Test Result:</strong><br>
When pinging the opposing IP from both computers, successful replies were received. The issue was resolved, and the Data Link Layer began functioning in sync.

  <h2>PROBLEM 9: Firewall (ACL) Misconfiguration</h2>
  <p><strong>🛠️Problem:</strong><br>
In this scenario, due to an incorrectly configured Access Control List (ACL) on the router, clients (Client PCs) are unable to access the server (Server) via HTTP. That is, when users type the server's IP address into the browser, the page does not load and a “host unreachable” or timeout error occurs.<br><br>

This issue involves both the Network Layer (L3) and the Application Layer (L7):<br>
• L3: Packet routing and ACL filtering<br>
• L7: Access to the HTTP application service<br>
</p>

<p><strong>❌ Faulty Configuration:</strong><br>
• The ACL (Access List 100) defined on the router is positioned to block HTTP (port 80) traffic.<br>
• This ACL was applied to the wrong interface (FastEthernet0/0) using the command `ip access-group 100 in`.<br>
</p>

<p><strong>📁 Faulty Scenario File:</strong><br>
<a href="cisco/S9-hatalı.pkt" target="_blank">L9 Faulty Scenario - Packet Tracer File</a> (.pkt)<br>

• Even though the HTTP service is enabled on the server, packets cannot pass through the router.<br>

<p><strong>✅ Solution:</strong><br>
• The existing ACL was removed via the router's CLI and the blocking rule was canceled.<br>
• If necessary, a new ACL that allows all traffic (permit ip any any) was defined.<br>
• Access to the HTTP-enabled server was successful and the test completed properly.<br>
</p>

<p><strong>🧩 Commands (Router CLI):</strong></p>
<pre>enable
configure terminal

no access-list 100
interface fastethernet0/0
no ip access-group 100 in
exit
</pre>
(Optional: Define a new ACL to allow all traffic):<br>
<pre>access-list 100 permit ip any any
interface fastethernet0/0
ip access-group 100 in
exit
</pre>

<p><strong>🔍 Test:</strong><br>
The web browser was opened from the Client PC and http://192.168.20.10 was accessed.<br>
The web page loaded correctly.<br>
It was confirmed that the issue was caused by the firewall (ACL).<br><br>
This scenario is a strong example of how misconfigured ACLs can disrupt network services and impact application layer functionality such as HTTP access.

  <h2>PROBLEM 10: Hardware Incompatibility Across All Layers</h2>
  <p><strong>🛠️Problem:</strong> In a network project, clients (PCs) are unable to access the server due to a lack of compatibility between layers. Detailed analysis revealed issues at the following layers:<br>

• L1 (Physical Layer): Coaxial cable was used instead of UTP.<br>
• L2 (Data Link Layer): MAC addresses were not configured properly.<br>
• L3 (Network Layer): IP address was not configured.<br>
• L4 (Transport Layer): Applications experience port number mismatches.<br>
• L7 (Application Layer): HTTP service is disabled or DNS name cannot be resolved.<br>

Such cross-layer errors often lead to difficult and time-consuming problems, especially in large-scale network projects.<br>
</p>

<p><strong>⚙️ Faulty Scenario in Cisco Packet Tracer:</strong><br>
• Phone cable (instead of UTP) was used for connections.<br>
• IP configuration is missing on the router.<br>
• Incorrect gateway settings on PCs.<br>
• HTTP service is not running on the server.<br>
• Devices connected to the switch are assigned to different VLANs.<br>
• DNS resolution fails, and "hostname unresolved" error is received.<br>

<p><strong>📁 Faulty Scenario File:</strong><br>
<a href="cisco/S10-hatalı.pkt" target="_blank">L10 Faulty Scenario - Packet Tracer File</a> (.pkt)<br>

<p><strong>✅ Solution:</strong><br>
• All devices must be connected with proper UTP cables.<br>
• Each device must be assigned a correct IP address and subnet mask.<br>
• The router should be assigned 192.168.1.1 as the default gateway and enabled.<br>
• All switch ports must be assigned to the same VLAN.<br>
• DNS and HTTP services must be installed and enabled on the server.<br>
• Connection must be verified using ping and browser tests.<br>
